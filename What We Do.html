            <p> Any student, adult, regardless of age or grade can teach any online courses. They 
                must prove their education and knowledge of the subject, by providing past graded
                test material and homework from past teachers or courses depending on the subject they 
                would like to teach. They must create a lesson plan, how homework must be submitted, and
                 times to discuss the content of the course with students. All teachers will be required 
                 to send in the podcasts they create based on the lessons of the textbook they use (Ex:
                  Lesson 1 of Saxon 1 Algebra Textbook). This content will be approved/disapproved based
                   on the content originality, depth, and comprehensibility for the student learning. After 
                   approving this content, the teacher will then be able to submit appropriate homework 
                   assignments (either partnering with an online program [Ex:MyMathLab], or creating
                    homework assignments by hand originally) to the State’s Department of Education,
                     which will be used for students to complete through this program. Once the process
                      of full approvement for the state’s department of education has been completed, 
                      the teacher’s podcasts and assignments will be accepted to be added onto the web
                       specific to the Free Education Project. Once completed, the teacher will be allowed
                        to set up meetings with students to discuss subject matters. Throughout the process 
                        of the course, students must complete a certain amount of homework assignments, 
                        attendance through the meetings of teachers, and exams taken in order to receive
                         the final course certification, 
                used for guarantee transfer within the state. (We are still working on this part!)</p>
